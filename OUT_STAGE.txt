====================> OUT STAGE <=====================================
    1. $out must be last stage in the pipeline
    2. If output collection doesnt exist, it will be created automatically


example => 

        db.persons.aggregate([
            {$group:{_id:"$age"}},
            {$out:"aggregationResults"}
        ])


        IMPORTANT NOTE:   
            1. It will not return anything but it will copy all the resultant data in new collection . 
            2. It will create new collection if it is now existed.
            3. In above example, aggregationResults is the new collection.
            4. It must be last stage of aggregation.
